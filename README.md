fss-fake-parallax
=================

quick tool 4 a [forseesense.com](http://forseesense.com) project. It fakes the parallax effect you get with 3D layers stacked in z space.  
##Why?  
Because sometimes using 3D layers can eat up a lot of render power. This can be applied and baked before rendering.
